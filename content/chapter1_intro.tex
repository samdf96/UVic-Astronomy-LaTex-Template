\startfirstchapter{Introduction}
\label{sec: intro}

The main goal of this AstroExample PDF, is to give an overview of what this template thesis will look like to the user. Additionally, the different sections contained within give specific examples of how to properly integrate typical astronomy-related content into a thesis. Chapter \ref{sec: tables} will cover what I believe to be the most comprehensive table packages that work well together, while also fulliling typical conventions for astronomy (these have been layed out similar to the \texttt{deluxetable} environment in AASTex). Chapter \ref{sec: citations} will cover how to properly cite references in a thesis, using the \texttt{natbib} package and the \texttt{aasjournal} bibliography style.

\section{UVic-based Information}

Unfortunately, UVic no longer provides a \LaTeX template for thesis writing. This used to be found on the UVicSpace site at the following location \url{https://libguides.uvic.ca/uvicspace/etds/latextemplate}. Although there are useful related links found there, an actual template is not provided.

What is somewhat useful, are the sample pages and UVic Thesis Guide, found at the following: \url{https://www.uvic.ca/graduatestudies/forms-policies/data/sample-samplepages.pdf}. This guide is what UVicSpace will accept in terms of formatting and content. The thesis template provided here conforms to these guidelines as of the writing of this document.
