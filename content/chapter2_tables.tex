\startchapter{Tables}
\label{sec: tables}

Similarly with other topics in \LaTeX, there are a multitude of different ways to achieve the same output. As with most basic implementations, Overleaf has fantastic resources. The following link is a great place to start for basic and slightly more advanced table implementations: \url{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tables}.

\section{Comprehensive Tables}
\label{sec: tables-comprehensive}

This section will cover what I believe is a fantastic way to implement basic and complex tables. This comes from my experience in working with the \texttt{deluxetable} environment in AASTex, and the related \texttt{aastex} package. Through the process of converting my paper content into my thesis template, I found that the \texttt{deluxetable} environment was not compatible with the University's thesis template, at least not to the extend that I needed it to be (the only change I could not make was the automated setting for the fontsize of the table).

Because of this, I searched for a more basic implementation in some other packages and workflows. While the generic \texttt{tabular} environment is a great place to start, it does not account for the complex table implementations that I needed (tables with merged cells, tables that spilled over pages, landscape tables, etc.).

The following is a list of the packages that allowed me the most flexibility in creating tables that I needed for my thesis. These are in order of the most basic to the most complex:

\subsection{Basis Packages}
\label{sec: tables-basis-packages}

These are what I describe as basis packages, which add in the ability to create tables that are more complex than the basic \texttt{tabular} environment, but are not as complex as the packages that will be discussed later in this section, which essentially have the abilities to \emph{merge} these environments together under one umbrella environment.


\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{longtable} - Allows the ability for tables to continue onto the next page. This is great for tables that are too long to fit on a single page.
    \item \texttt{tabularx} - Allows the column designator \texttt{x} to be used, which will automatically adjust the column width in order for the table to fill the declared width of the environment.
    \item \texttt{threeparttable} - Provides a scheme for tables that have a structured note section after the caption.
    \item \texttt{booktabs} - Provides some additional commands to enhance the quality of tables.
    \item \texttt{caption} - Provides the ability to customize the caption of the table. Specifically useful for tables that are too long to fit on a single page (continued captions).
    \item \texttt{multirow} - Provides the ability to merge cells in the row direction.
    \item \texttt{pdflscape} - Provides the ability to create landscape tables.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Extension Packages}
\label{sec: tables-extension-packages}

As mentioned above, these packages are extensions of the basic packages, and allow for more complex table implementations. These are what made all the different packages work together in a seamless way.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{threeparttablex} - This package extends the \texttt{threeparttable} package to work with tables created using the \texttt{longtable} package.
    \item \texttt{xltabular} - This package extends the \texttt{longtable} and \texttt{tabularx} packages to work together. Introduces the \texttt{xltabular} environment.
\end{itemize}

\section{Example Tables}
\label{sec: tables-example}

Here is a regular \texttt{tabular} environment, modified by the \texttt{booktabs} package. This is a great way to start creating tables, as it is simple and easy to understand. The \texttt{booktabs} package provides some additional commands to enhance the quality of tables such as the \texttt{toprule}, \texttt{midrule}, and \texttt{bottomrule} commands.

The following is the templated code for the table:

\lstinputlisting[language=TeX]{content/chapter2_tables_simpletable.tex}

The compiled from the above templated code is the following:

\input{content/chapter2_tables_simpletable.tex}

Extending this to use a \texttt{threeparttable} environment, including a caption and notes, would be the following:

\lstinputlisting[language=TeX]{content/chapter2_tables_threeparttable.tex}

The compiled from the above templated code is the following:

\input{content/chapter2_tables_threeparttable.tex}

Expanding now to use the \texttt{tabularx} environment for automatic re-sizing of the columns. For reference, in this example, all columns but the first use the \texttt{X} designation. The following code would be used:

\lstinputlisting[language=TeX]{content/chapter2_tables_tabularx.tex}

The compiled from the above templated code is the following:

\input{content/chapter2_tables_tabularx.tex}

The last example will be a combination of all the above packages, including the \texttt{longtable} package to allow the table to continue onto the next page, the \texttt{multirow} package to merge cells in the row direction, and the \texttt{pdflscape} package to create a landscape table. The following code will be used (data and header information have been selectively trimmed for readability):

\lstinputlisting[language=TeX]{content/chapter2_tables_complex_trimmed.txt}

\input{content/chapter2_tables_complex.tex}
